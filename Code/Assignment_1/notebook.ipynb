    "Some of the code you need to complete this project is provided as part of this reposiotory.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Installing Conda**\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, you'll need to install conda, which is a package manager for Python. You can do this by following these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **For Windows**: Download the Anaconda installer from the official Anaconda website: <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual>. Choose the \"Custom\" installation option and select only the \"conda\" component.\n",
    "2. **For macOS (using Homebrew)**: Run the following command in your terminal: `brew install anaconda`\n",
    "3. **For Linux**: You can install conda using a package manager like apt-get or yum, or by downloading the installer from the Anaconda website.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating an Environment**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have installed conda, you can create a new environment to isolate your Python packages and dependencies. Here's how:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a terminal or command prompt.\n",
    "2. Type `conda create env -f <path-to-\"envirnoment.yml\">`\n",
    "3. Activate the environment by typing `conda activate ttk4265`.\n",
    "4. You should now see `(ttk4265)` at the beginning of your command prompt, indicating that you are working within the newly created environment.\n",
    "5. The packages you need should be included then\n",
    "6. To install other packages or dependencies, use the `conda install` command followed by the package name (e.g., `conda install numpy`).\n",
    "7. When you're finished working in this environment, deactivate it by typing `conda deactivate`."
