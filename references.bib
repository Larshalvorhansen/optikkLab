abstract = {This study describes rapid prototype construction of small and lightweight push broom Hyper Spectral Imagers (HSI). The dispersive element housings are printed by a thermoplastic 3D printer combined with S-mount optical components and commercial off-the-shelf camera heads. Four models with a mass less than 200 g are presented with a spectral range in the visible to the near-infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The bandpass is in the range from 1.4 - 5 nm. Three test experiments with motorized gimbals to stabilize attitude show that the instruments are capable of push broom spectral imaging from various platforms, including airborne drone to handheld operations.},

	abstract = {The HYPSO-1 satellite, a 6U CubeSat carrying a hyperspectral imager, was launched on 13 January 2022, with the Goal of imaging ocean color in support of marine research. This article describes the development and current status of the mission and payload operations, including examples of agile planning, captures with low revisit time and time series acquired during a campaign. The in-orbit performance of the hyperspectral instrument is also characterized. The usable spectral range of the instrument is in the range of 430 nm to 800 nm over 120 bands after binning during nominal captures. The spatial resolvability is found empirically to be below 2.2 pixels in terms of Full-Width at Half-Maximum (FWHM) at 565 nm. This measure corresponds to an inherent ground resolvable resolution of 142 m across-track for close to nadir capture. In the across-track direction, there are 1216 pixels available, which gives a swath width of 70 km. However, the 684 center pixels are used for nominal captures. With the nominal pixels used in the across-track direction, the nadir swath-width is 40 km. The spectral resolution in terms of FWHM is estimated to be close to 5 nm at the center wavelength of 600 nm, and the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is evaluated to be greater than 300 at 450 nm to 500 nm for Top-of-Atmosphere (ToA) signals. Examples of images from the first months of operations are also shown.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the design of a pushbroom hyperspectral imager built for small satellite applications. Its design allows for low weight, low cost, and flexible configuration making it accessible to both smaller projects and supplemental to larger ones. The imager is constructed from commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) optical and sensor components, along with a machined mechanical structure to enable rapid development times. The presented configuration was selected based on a 6U CubeSat ocean color mission developed at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The optical design includes three 50 mm lens objectives, a precision-cut 50 μm slit, a blazed transmission grating, and a detecting CMOS sensor. It has the ability to record wavelengths in the spectral range of 300−1000 nm, e.g. in the visible and near infrared spectrum. The calculated bandpass of typically about 5 nm can be configured or binned for the specific application needs. Since targets, such as the ocean surface, are dark and non-Lambertian, it is challenging to reach the necessary sensitivity that ensures a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the image. The imaging system presented in this paper is built for obtaining that sufficient SNR for a given resolution, both in the spatial and spectral domains. The satellite will be launched into a 500 km altitude sun-synchronous orbit. While in orbit, the imager utilizes the pushbroom concept of sequentially gathering lines of pixels, of all wavelengths in range, as it passes over its target. The pushbroom concept, combined with the optical design, yields a swath width of up to 70 km per scan line with a sampling distance of 49 × 60 m on ground. A final consideration must be made due to the large size of raw hyperspectral data cubes and the constraints this sets on satellite power consumption for downlink. This can be significantly improved through onboard image processing (e.g. correction, classification, anomaly detection, feature extraction, and dimensionality reduction) rather than in the physical design itself. Performance characteristics of this specific imager are presented along with a trade-off analysis of configuration possibilities in the optical design.},
